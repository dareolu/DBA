General Overview
1. Download and Install VMWare to allow you have your own server on your machine/Laptop  --Have at least 4GB memory (8 is better)
2. Download and Deploy Windows Server 2012 R2 on VMWare  Workstation Player (Deploy 3 servers)
3. Download SQL Server 2016 and latest update from buildnumbers.wordpress.com/sqlserver/
4. Create Domain controller
5. Add 2 other servers to the DC
6. Configure network fileshare for Quorum configuration, and AlwaysOn Synchronization
7. Configure Windows Failover Clustering (AlwaysOn mode)
8. Install SQL Server 2016
9. Configure AlwaysOn Availability groups
10.Run sp_blitz for HealthCheck (Stored Procedure by Brent Ozar Unlimited)

*******************************************
Vmware Configuration
--Moving files between Local and Virtual server easily

--Change Networking settings to Bridged

Reason
1. Bridged connects to virtual network by using the network adapter on the host system. If the host system is on a network, Bridged networking is often the easiest way
to give the virtual machine access to that network

2. NAT Networking, the virtual machine does not have its own IP address on the external network. Instead a private network is set up on the host system.
Therefore, it will seem like they are on different network

3. Host-only networking creates a network that is completely contained within the host computer. the networking is only visible to the 
host through a virtual private network.


*******************************************
Set up Domain Controller Environment


--What is a DC?
A Domain controller is a server on a Microsoft Windows that is responsible for allowing host access to Windows domain resources. 
It stores user account information, authenticates users and enforces security policy for a Windows domain.



--Install Active directory feature
--promote to Domain controller on DC server
--create a SQL Service Account administrator on the Domain Controller Server
--Create SQL Admin Domain user account for each server



Cluster Management => Service Account (Domain USer)
SQL Management => Service Account (Domain User)  -Local Administrator Rights

*******************************************

Windows Server Environment
--set the timezone on all servers appropraitely
--Disable firewall on all servers
--Add NET framework 3.5 on all servers
--Add Failover cluster feature on all nodes
--Add Application Server role on all nodes if you will be needed Distributed transactions for MSDTC
--Name the servers appropriately
--Connect using RDC
--Join the node to the domain
--Create a file share on the fileshare server and grant permissions
